							Getting used to an entirely different culture can be challenging. While it’s also nice to
							learn about cultures online or from books, nothing comes close to experiencing cultural
							diversity in person. You learn to appreciate each and every single one of the differences
							while you become more culturally fluid.

								The real voyage of discovery consists not in seeking new landscapes, but having new
								eyes.

						<p>Life doesn't allow us to execute every single plan perfectly. This really seems to be the
							case when you travel. You plan it down to every minute with a big checklist; but when it
							comes to executing it, something always comes up and you’re left with your improvising
							skills. You learn to adapt as you go. Here’s how my travel checklist looks now:</p>
						<ul>
							<li>buy a ticket:
								<ul>
									<li>for a plane, or</li>
									<li>for a train</li>
								</ul>
							</li>
							<li>start your adventure</li>
						</ul>

				<h2>Inline Editor </h2>

				<div class="row row-editor">
					<div class="editor inline" id="e2">
						<p>
							Going to a new place can be terrifying. While change and uncertainty makes us scared,
							traveling teaches us how ridiculous it is to be afraid of something before it happens. The
							moment you face your fear and see there was nothing to be afraid of, is the moment you
							discover bliss.
						</p>
