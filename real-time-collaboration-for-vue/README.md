# CKEditor 5 real-time collaborative editing sample for Vue.js

> [!WARNING] 
> Please bear in mind that these collaboration samples have not yet been updated along with the requirements of [New installation methods](https://ckeditor.com/docs/ckeditor5/latest/updating/nim-migration/migration-to-new-installation-methods.html) introduced with CKEditor 5 v42.0.0. We are working on it.

This repository presents an integration of CKEditor 5 WYSIWYG editor including
[real-time collaboration features](https://ckeditor.com/docs/ckeditor5/latest/features/collaboration/real-time-collaboration/real-time-collaboration.html) and [Vue.js](https://vuejs.org/).

The integration supports Vue.js from version 2.0.0. The `package.json` file stores the higher version just to ensure that all dependencies are in compatible versions.

## Quick start

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone git@github.com:ckeditor/ckeditor5-collaboration-samples.git
   cd ckeditor5-collaboration-samples/real-time-collaboration-for-vue
   ```

2. Open the `dist/index.html` page in the browser.

3. Fill the dialog with correct websocket and token URL endpoints. If you have a different token URL for CKBox service, you should provide it as well. Otherwise the token URL will be used both for Collaboration Features and for CKBox. If you do not have these yet or do not know their meaning, [contact us](https://ckeditor.com/contact/). 

4. Copy the URL and share it or paste in another tab to enjoy real-time collaborative editing.

## Overview

The sample consists of a simple Vue.js application using CKEditor 5 with [real-time collaborative editing](https://ckeditor.com/docs/ckeditor5/latest/features/collaboration/real-time-collaboration/real-time-collaboration.html). The application includes the editor with [the users presence list](https://ckeditor.com/docs/ckeditor5/latest/features/collaboration/real-time-collaboration/users-in-real-time-collaboration.html#users-presence-list) together with [real-time collaborative comments and track changes](https://ckeditor.com/docs/ckeditor5/latest/features/collaboration/real-time-collaboration/real-time-collaboration.html) using a sidebar and a responsive [display mode](https://ckeditor.com/docs/ckeditor5/latest/features/collaboration/comments/comments-display-mode.html) integration which reacts to the screen width.

It does not require the build step. However, if you want to modify the build, for instance to add more plugins, refer to the [Creating your own build](#creating-your-own-build) section below.

The application uses the `<ckeditor>` Vue.js component, which is a wrapper for the Vue.js interface provided by the [@ckeditor/ckeditor5-vue](https://github.com/ckeditor/ckeditor5-vue) package.

To learn more about the integration and the `@ckeditor/ckeditor5-vue` package check out the [Vue.js integration guide](https://ckeditor.com/docs/ckeditor5/latest/builds/guides/integration/frameworks/vuejs.html).

## Creating your own build

The CKEditor build created for the purpose of this example is based on [classic editor](https://ckeditor.com/docs/ckeditor5/latest/builds/guides/overview.html#classic-editor), but you can use any other [available CKEditor 5 build](https://github.com/ckeditor/ckeditor5#editors) as a base. To change the editor, import it in the `src/components/sample.vue` file and change the `:editor=" classicEditor "` property later in this file.

If you want to customize the build, edit the application (inside the `src/` directory) and then build it with the following commands:

```bash
npm install
npm run build
```

Note: After installation the dev server can be run using `npm run server`.

See the [CKEditor 5 Installing plugins guide](https://ckeditor.com/docs/ckeditor5/latest/builds/guides/integration/installing-plugins.html) to learn more.

The build process uses `vue.config.js` which extends Vue CLI configuration. It supports `.vue` extension for Vue.js components, PostCSS and SVG imports. Check the [CKEditor 5 Advanced setup guide](https://ckeditor.com/docs/ckeditor5/latest/builds/guides/integration/advanced-setup.html#webpack-configuration) for some advanced webpack configurations and [Vue.js Configuration guide](https://cli.vuejs.org/config/) which will explain how to achieve it using `vue.config.js` file.

Also, if you are not interested in Vue.js CLI, it is possible to create a webpack config from scratch that would fit your needs using [`vue-loader` guide](https://vue-loader.vuejs.org/guide/#manual-setup).
